# 35. Completed Boilerplate
Over the next few lectures, **we will be installing some dependencies. We have provided a boilerplate that you can use to avoid version issues or conflicts.**

To use the boilerplate:

1.  Download the zip file attached to this lecture.

2.  Unzip / Extract the contents of the zip file:
    -   If you are using macOS, unzip to the **/Users/YourUserName** location.
    -   If you are using Windows, unzip to the **C:\Users\YourUserName** location.

3.  Using your terminal application (GitBash for Windows, Terminal for macOS), change into the inbox project directory by running the `cd ~/inbox` command. Note - This command will fail if you have unzipped the file to a location other than what was suggested in step #2.

4.  Using your terminal, run `npm install` inside the root of the inbox project (where the package.json file is).

6.  DO NOT run "npm audit" or "npm audit fix" as this will break your project's dependencies!

**If you are using this boilerplate, you won't need to install any dependencies for the Inbox project written in Section Two. You will also not need to perform any of the setup steps in the upcoming "Boilerplate Requirements" lecture.**

**Important -** At the moment, the lectures only support Solidity version 0.4.17. We recommend sticking with the suggested versions used in the course to learn the fundamental concepts. After completion, upgrading to the latest dependency releases and refactoring would be a great continuing education exercise. Full instructions to accomplish this are provided at the [end of the section](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/lecture/28943812#questions).

**Windows Installation Issues**

If you are using Windows, you may need to install additional dependencies.

**If you have attempted to install the boilerplate and get errors about Visual Studio C++ tools not being installed or MSBuild errors then the following steps should help you:**
