#   23. Deploying Contract in New Remix UI
In the upcoming lecture, we will be using the Remix editor to deploy a contract to the Remix VM (Previously named the JavaScript VM). This note will go over a few things that are a bit different.

Instead of the **Run** tab in the old UI, we need to click the **Ethereum Icon** in the left sidebar:

Then, you should see a familiar-looking form. The **JavaScript VM** has been renamed the **Remix VM**. The **Create** button from the old UI has been renamed **Deploy**. When you enter a string and click the button, the deployed contract will appear in a dropdown filter in the **Deployed Contracts** section. You'll need to click the downward-facing arrow to expose the contract functions.
