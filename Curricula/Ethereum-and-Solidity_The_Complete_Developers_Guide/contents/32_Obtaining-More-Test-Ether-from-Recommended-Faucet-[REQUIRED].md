#   32. Obtaining More Test Ether from Recommended Faucet [REQUIRED]

The faucets available to obtain test Ether from will change very, very frequently. Some faucets that are stable for a long time may begin to suffer network outages or stop funding due to excessive demand. This note will provide instructions on how to use a faucet that is currently working best to fund the most amount of requests for test Ether.

Currently, we suggest the ChainLink faucet.

1.  Visit https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby

1.  Make sure you are signed into Metamask in your browser, and the **Rinkeby Test Network** is selected:

3.  Temporarily disable any other wallet extensions you may have running in the browser (such as the Coinbase wallet). These wallets will cause a conflict with Metamask when trying to obtain funds.

4.  Click the **Connect wallet** button in the top right corner of the page:

5.  Check the I'm not a robot verification

6.  Click Send request (Important - You'll probably want to make three requests to get at least 0.3 Ether to use in the course. You can always come back for more if you need)

**Important** - while the ChainLink faucet is very stable it also does suffer outages from time to time. You can also try the following Alchemy faucet:

##  **Using a different Test Network**

If you are unable to obtain test ether from any Rinkeby faucet, or, you would prefer to try out a different test network, please see the following options below:

### Kovan Network

Visit the ChainLink Kovan faucet at this address:

https://faucets.chain.link/kovan

### Goerli Network

This network uses the same concept as Rinkeby with an authenticated faucet that requires a public tweet. However, they provide more funds and do not seem to suffer as many outages as Rinkeby.

Visit the faucet at this address:

https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/

To request funds via Twitter, make a tweet with your Ethereum address pasted into the contents (surrounding text doesn't matter).
Copy-paste the tweets URL into the above input box and fire away!

Make sure these are public tweets! You can safely delete them after you've received your Ether.

They also have a simple faucet that does not require social posts but only provides 0.05 ether:

https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/

### Using a different network throughout the course

The test network used to take the course does not matter as long as you have test ether for that specific network. When using Metamask, make sure to change the network from Rinkeby as shown in the videos to whichever test network you decided to use.

Later in the course, you will be using Infura to deploy contracts. It will be important to select the Infura URL for the specific testnet you are using instead of the Rinkeby testnet.
