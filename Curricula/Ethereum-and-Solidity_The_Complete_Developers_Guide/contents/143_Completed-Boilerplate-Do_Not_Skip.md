# 143. Completed Boilerplate - Do Not Skip

In the next lecture, we will be installing some dependencies for our Kickstart Campaign project.

**We have provided a boilerplate that you can use to avoid version issues or conflicts.** Download the boilerplate attached to this lecture to where you typically develop and run `npm install`.

If you are not using the boilerplate provided, you'll need to make sure you are installing the latest version of web3

```
npm install web3
```

You will also need to use a specific version of solc:

```
npm install solc@0.4.17
```

**Important** - At the moment, the lectures only support Solidity version 0.4.17. We recommend sticking with the suggested versions used in the course to learn the fundamental concepts. After completion, upgrading to the latest dependency releases and refactoring would be a great continuing education exercise. Full instructions to accomplish this are provided at the end of the section.
