#   57. Super Important Note about Seed / Recovery Phrase Security

In the upcoming lecture, we will be adding the wallet seed phrase generated by Metamask to our provider. **If you are currently using a Metamask account/wallet with real money or Ether associated with it, STOP IMMEDIATELY.**

You must create a new wallet specifically for the purpose of taking this course or doing practice development.

In production, the seed phrase or private keys should never be hardcoded (instead, you would read from environment variables). Since this is an online course, you will very likely store your code in Github, or, be requested to share code containing the seed phrase for debugging purposes. If you are using a development only wallet that has no real value then there will be no real risk other than someone potentially stealing your test ethers.
