# What is a smart contract - Solidity

Welcome to your fantastic journey ahead.

We have a very exciting adventure lined up of lots of code and interesting things to learn to gather and elevate our knowledge and skills.

Before we dive into the ocean of solidity and fill our minds with treasures of discovery, let's put on our coding scuba gear, so to speak, and begin by formally defining what our smart contracts on block chain, because every single new topic we are going to learn in this course.

And believe me, there are there is much, much for us to cover ahead is essentially derived in smart contracts.

We are building smart contracts, smart contracts that get addresses, smart contracts that keep track of chocolate bars and food, smart contracts that run calculations with function overloading.

Pretty much everything we are going to do and cover in this course is a smart contract, solidity.

And by the way, this is solidity right here.

This is the language.

This is what you will learn.

And I promise, even if you have no idea what this means now, you will be able to read this from start to finish.

No problem.

By the end of this course, solidity is a curly bracket language.

You see these curly brackets.

That's another way of saying object oriented.

They don't say that slithy doesn't like to say that.

But it is it's an object oriented language when we build voting systems or auctions or decentralized exchanges or NFTY marketplaces, we do this by writing these contracts.

You see that we write these contracts.

We are always going to write these these contracts.

Now, these contracts are very similar to classes in C++.

And it's OK if you don't know what that means.

Solidity is a language that is heavily inspired by C++ and JavaScript and Python two.

And if it's your first language, that's all the better.

Because because what a gateway, what a what a what an amazing gateway to start on your journey ahead.

But I just want to point out to you that the word contract here, that when we write our code in solidity, we write it in these contracts.

These are smart contracts on the solidity side.

And then our code goes in here.

So what our smart contracts as a formal definition on block chain.

Well, smart contracts are digital contracts stored on a block chain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met.

That's really all it they are, essentially.

All right.

So you could just think about it as coded agreement's terms and conditions agreements.

You know, if you made some sort of an agreement with anybody, whatever, that may be a contract.

But these are smart because the computer executes them.

They belong to the computers.

And so let's define it again.

Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a block chain that run when predetermined conditions are met.

So learning solidity is all about mastering smart contracts.

All right.

So what we are going to be doing in this course is writing, observing, critically, analyzing, building, dismantling, reverse engineering, everything we can do, flipping inside and out, smart contracts left, right and center so that you can become confident and master this craft.

And in so doing, also elevate your skills as a developer on the whole with good conventions, problem solving techniques and a lot of good other things.

So we've got a lot to cover.

We've got quite an adventure ahead together.

And all roads ahead lead to defy.
